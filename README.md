# ðŸ’» My Developer Portfolio

Welcome to my dev space. I'm here to share stuff that I find interesting on my journey; which are mostly with **Rust**, **Python**, and **JavaScript**. This is where I keep all my projectsâ€”some cool, some experimental, but all part of the grind.

## ðŸ”§ What's Inside?

- **Rust:** you'll know why.
- **Python:** My go-to for quick hacks, scripts, and solid backend work.
- **JavaScript:** Making the web tick, one line at a time.

## ðŸŽ¯ The Goal

I'm here to learn, build, and break things. This repo is where I document the journey. It's not about perfectionâ€”it's about progress.

## ðŸ’¬ Hit Me Up

Got something to say? Wanna collab or just talk code? Drop me a line. im down for it :)
